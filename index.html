                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a highly skilled problem solver and collaborator, stemming
                    from a history as a teacher, musician, and freelancer. I excel
                    at managing mulitiple projects while staying focused on the end goal and 
                    maintaining composure under pressure. With extensive experience in making the most of 
                    limited resources, I bring a deep dedication to excellence, shaped by a lifelong
                    career in music.
